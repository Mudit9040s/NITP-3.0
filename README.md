# Model 1
  ## CROP FERTILITY CHECK
  1. This Model aims as Checking the Fertility of the soil.
  2. We can check whether the soil is Fertile for growing any kind of crop or not.
  3. The Page is Integrated with ML model having 98% accuracy for predicting the desired results.
  4. The major inputs given to the model through the WebApp are Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, EC(electrical conductivity).
  
# Model 2
 ## CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
  1. This model aims as Recommending the best suitable crop based on the soil properties.
  2. Once the Soil Fertility is checked the recommendation system works for recommending crops to the farmer.
  3. Farmers can get to know about the required conditions and information about the soil.
  4. It majorly takes inputs such as Temperature, Humidity, ph, Rainfall.
